- # Work experience

  - ### **Thales, Rennes, France.** Since October 2018.
    ## Cloud DevOps Engineer: On-premise solution architecture
    Working for Thales, I have been one of the first, and main contributor to the **Military Digital Stack** (MDS) Thales Group inner-source project: a private, highly-available and secured Platform-as-a-Service product built atop **RedHat OpenShift**; to be deployed in **disconnected and resource-constrained environments**.
    My main responsibilities on the project include:
    - Helping to define and implement the **High-Level Design and architecture** of the MDS platform;
    - **Automating the deployment of all prerequisites to the installation of OpenShift** in a **disconnected**, on-premise environment using **Ansible**. This was thought and designed to be **as platform-agnostic as possible**, making it possible to build a complete highly-available OpenShift cluster from scratch in a matter of minutes, in both virtualized (e.g., RedHat Virtualization, VMWare...) and "bare-metal" environments;
    - Provisioning additional development resources "as-a-Service" on top of OpenShift using the **Operators API**;
    - Containerizing highly performant **Data Plane Development Kit** (DPDK) applications in the most secure (without any privilege escalation to be required) and minimal way as possible (our fully-loaded DPDK images ended up clocking in less than 40MB!);
    - Coming up with the best possible way to **run stateful applications** (e.g., Apache Kafka, Storm...) in **production-ready, latency-critical** and **highly-available** OpenShift environments.

  - ### **Orange Labs, Rennes, France.** Internship: Feb. - Aug. 2018 (6 Mo.).
    ## Fog computing & IoT Security engineering
    Working for Orange "Smart Access in Digital Home" R&D department, I contributed to the development of solutions to secure vulnerable Internet ­of ­Things (IoT) devices in home networks from network attacks.
    To that extent, I prototyped a **network router capable of dynamic isolation**, and **abnormal activity detection in the LAN**; a project for which Orange, my tutor and I filled **two patent applications**. This included:
    - Porting **Docker** onto a tiny, **resource-constrained embedded environment**, and coming up with a micro­-service **software architecture**, to enable fast delivery and code check against a variety of Linux system environments and processing architectures;
    - Cross-compiling open­-source **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) software** onto a Livebox-compatible router environment through tiny Docker images (clocking in a minimized rootfs generated using **Buildroot**); enabling dynamic network vulnerability and attack detection in the LAN (**open-source contributions** to the Buildroot project, nmap...);
    - Proposing, formalising and implementing an innovative, **smart and dynamic firewall solution**, enhanced with **machine learning**, which computes minimal isolation rules to secure the LAN based on behavioural analysis of IoT devices, and network attack detection.

  - ### **TECH4RACE, Rennes, France.** Internship: June - Sep. 2017 (4 Mo.).
    ## Software development for the Internet of Things
    A **challenging and rewarding growth experience**, working for an ambitious start­up company, where I contributed to the development an app **collecting and interpreting data from smart GPS trackers**, providing real­-time monitoring to out­door sport events.
    - **Key skills:** CI/CD, Python, IoT, RabbitMQ, Angular.

  - ### **Berakah Peneil, Yangon, Myanmar ![Myanmar flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Flag_of_Myanmar.svg "Myanmar flag")** Internship: June - Aug. 2016 (3 Mo.).
    ## Web and mobile application development
    A very enriching experience of **adaptability** and **interpersonal skills** abroad, during which I prototyped a **video­conferencing web app using the WebRTC API**, allowing general practitioners to provide medical diagnosis to patients in remote areas with no access to medical care.
    - **Key skills:** NodeJS, RESTful API, WebRTC, Angular, Ionic Framework.
